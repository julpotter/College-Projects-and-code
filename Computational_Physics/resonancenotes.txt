Resonances
Kepler's 3rd law
Period^2 = 4pi^2a^3/(GM)
Resonance


For every one orbit of jupiter going around the sun, asteroid goes twice around

Resonance condition:
P(asteroid)/P(Jupiter) = 1/n
1:2
[2:3]
1:3 

(4pi^2 a^3(asteroid)/(GM) )/4pi^2 a^3(jupiiter)/(GM) = 1/n^2 ==> a(asteroid) = a(jupiter)/n^(2/3)
a(asteroid) = a(jupiter)n^(-2/3)
