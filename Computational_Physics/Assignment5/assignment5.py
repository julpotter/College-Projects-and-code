1. Help Dak Prescott keep his starting position as quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys.
Prescott offers you a lucrative consulting fee to determine the optimum angle of launch
for a pass. He can throw the ball with an initial speed of 30 m/s. Write a Python program
that uses the modified solves the equations of motion assuming quadratic air resistance.
The terminal velocity of a football is 45 m/s. Plot the range as a function of the angle.
Answer the following questions:
(a) At what launch angle (to the nearest Â½o, he is very accurate, you know) should he
throw the ball for the greatest range in air?
(b) Any capable quarterback can throw a football up to 80 yards; do your results
agree with this observation?

Terminal velocity is 12.558 m/s
This finding is a bit less than that record. This is likely because
the world-record holder had reduced drag and more mass, so he had 
higher terminal velocity.
