A 4.0 m steel beam with a cross sectional area of 1.0 × 10–2 m2 and a Young's modulus of 2.0 × 1011 N/m2 is wedged horizontally between two vertical walls. In order to wedge the beam, it is compressed by 0.020 mm. If the coefficient of static friction between the beam and the walls is 0.35, the maximum mass (including its own) it can bear without slipping is:
