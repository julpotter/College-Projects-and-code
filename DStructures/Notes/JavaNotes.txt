x.length — finds length of x.
x++      — adds 1 to x
&&      — and
==       — is

words.endsWith(r)
word.substring(word.length() - r.length(), word.length())
word.substring(word.length() - r.length());

return immediately ends the method



line = line.replaceAll ("[^a-zA-Z ]", "") — 
	^ (not) used to replace all characters not in the alphabet


Overloading constructors
	Sonnet() — defaults
	Sonnet (String scheme) — build a sonnet according to
		the scheme
	Sonnet s = new Sonnet ("ABBACDDCEFFEGG")
	Sonnet s = new Sonnet ("ABBA", 5) — build 5 stanzas
	

Static methods that poem writers will find useful:
	get Word
	get RhymingWord
	writeLine (5, "|--|--|--|", "EY0 T")

String s = "Hi There!"
s.toLowerCase() = "hi there!"

Static fields and methods are associated with the class and not with
	the objects of the class
The objects can see/use the static fields/methods, but they are class
	things. Objects don't get their own.

"\n" — new line


PREPROCESSING — big idea in CS. Waste time up front
	to save time later

Declare x to be an array of strings—
	String[] x = new String[--];

Singleton pattern 
pronunciations will be global
instantiated the first time it is neededd
checked for every time

Side effects
Does not return a value, rather, just does the works and leaves
the change behind.
